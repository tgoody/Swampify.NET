Uses sockets to connect users into a "group" on the server, each authenticated through Spotify.

Uses Spotify's API to collect data about user selected playlists and analyze the songs in them.

Group leader will then have a playlist on their Spotify account with the amalgamation of everyone's songs that match the settings.
